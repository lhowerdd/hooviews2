This project is a course reviews application. The app was developed by myself and 4 others with javafx for the frontend and jdbc/sqlite3 for the backend. 
In this project I contributed mainly to the views and persistence of login and account creation, and also started the development for the general database and scene
management. This project was developed in intellij, and it should be easy to build with gradle by using the provided build file. This project was built
to run on Java JDK 17.09 and JavaFX 17.09. The project can be run by running CourseReviewsApplication.java after adding the line 
--module-path
/path/to/javafx-sdk-17.0.9/lib
--add-modules
javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
as a vm argument under run configurations.
